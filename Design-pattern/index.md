# Design pattern

## Why ?

- Common architectural approaches
- Popularized by the Gang of four book (1994)
- Translated to many OOP languages
- Universally relevant and internalized in some language

## SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Pattern

- A single class will have only a single responsibility
- An antipattern can be implement which will go against the idea of design pattern
- The importance of this is to avoid creating god objects or objects/entity that have many responsibilty by implementing separation of concerns and only allow one class to only each have one responsibility

### Open Closed Principle

- The term came from the sole belief of **_Open for extension, but close for modification_**
- This allows behavior to be extended without modifying its undelying source code
- Understanding of Generics and Interfaces in object oriented programming is important
- **_Open for extension means_** - Open to be inherit or implemented (class/interface)
- **_Close for modification_** - Modifying the core logic of the code

### Liskov Subtitution Principle

- Able to subtitute subclass for a base class without anything breaking

### Interface Segregation Principle

- Split interface into smaller interfaces
