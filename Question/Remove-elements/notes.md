### Question

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesnâ€™t matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

```py
class RemoveElement:
    def removeElement(nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        # Counter for keeping track of elements other than val
        count = 0
        # Loop through all the elements of the array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                # If the element is not val
                nums[count] = nums[i]
                count += 1
        return count
/**

0 => 3
3 => 3

[3, 2, 2, 3]

 i = 0
 count = 0
 [3, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 1
 count = 1
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 2
 count = 1
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 3
 count = 2
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
