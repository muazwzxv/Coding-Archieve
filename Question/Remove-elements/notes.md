### Question

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesnâ€™t matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[count++] = nums[i];
                System.out.println(Arrays.toString(nums));
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

/**

0 => 3
3 => 3

[3, 2, 2, 3]

 i = 0
 count = 0
 [3, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 1
 count = 1
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 2
 count = 1
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
 
 i = 3
 count = 2
 [2, 2, 2, 3]
